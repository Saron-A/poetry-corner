          I wished on fairies<br />
          for you.<br /><br />

          I wore my heart on my sleeves,<br />
          and gave it away to anyone new.<br /><br />

          But I was searching for you<br />
          in millions of eyes.<br /><br />

          I was scrutinizing every iris,<br />
          for that peculiar shade of yours—<br /><br />

          for that hue that made me fall.<br /><br />

          I tried to kill this love,<br />
          so it could reincarnate in a different heart.<br /><br />

          But I guess I'm bound to fall for you<br />
          in every life.<br /><br />

          For a hint of your scent has blended with my soul,<br />
          and each rebirth feels like a chain of thorns,<br /><br />

          stinging this sore heart,<br />
          deprived of you.
