          To tell you of my tears<br />
          The cause being me<br />
          To erupt as a volcano<br />
          Been dormant for years<br />
          Suddenly breaking out with all this malice<br />
          To cry before you<br />
          And let the tears tell you of my days<br />
          my nights<br />
          My life so far<br />
          Since we last seen<br />
          Well I've been on a train going downhill<br />
          You'd know since you see everything<br />
          When you search my heart what do you see<br />
          the bitterness and darkness<br />
          Yet what is beneath ?<br />
          I feel shallow<br />
          I see myself headed towards an inescapable pit<br />
          Where vipers glide over one another<br />
          Intertwine their bodies<br />
          Open their mouth to receive me<br />
          And tear me apart<br />
          Hopping on the devil's trampoline<br />
          Like he tossed me high on purpose<br />
          Towards the west in the middle of the day<br />
          And when the sun set<br />
          I sank in through the dark<br />
          Onto my deathbed<br />
          My headstone smeared by the sanctity I wasted<br />
          Blood resurfacing from the dirt<br />
          I realized I should have let up my life<br />
          When I had the chance to see your holy gates<br />
          To hear the angels' halos<br />
          Now all I see is the scarlet of flames<br />
          Waiting to blaze my soul<br />
          The magots<br />
          Waiting to burrow my bones<br />
          You<br />
          Waiting to cast me out with the demons<br />
          The love I once saw in your eyes<br />
          Replaced by disappointment and disdain<br />
          I deserve it all<br />
          Your wrath is my justified fate<br />
          Yet I hope you know my regrets<br />
          How remorseful those day without you have been.
