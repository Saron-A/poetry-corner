      To tell you of my tears
      The cause being me
      To erupt as a volcano
      Been dormant for years
      Suddenly breaking out with all this malice
      To cry before you
      And let the tears tell you of my days
      my nights
      My life so far
      Since we last seen
      Well I've been on a train going down hill
      You'd know since you see everything
      When you search my heart what do you see
      the bitterness and darkness
      Yet what is beneath ?
      I feel shallow
      I see myself headed towards an inescapable pit
      Where vipers glide over one another
      Intertwine their bodies
      Open their mouth to receive me
      And tear me apart,
      Hopping on the devil's trampoline
      Like he tossed me high on purpose
      Towards the west in the middle of the day
      And when the sun set
      I sank in through the dark
      Onto my deathbed
      My headstone smeared by the sanctity I wasted
      Blood resurfacing from the dirt
      I realized I should have let up my life
      When I had the chance to see your holy gates
      To hear the angels' halos
      Now all I see is the scarlet of flames
      Waiting to blaze my soul
      The magots
      Waiting to burrow my bones
      You
      Waiting to cast me out with the demons
      The love I once saw in your eyes
      Replaced by disappointment and disdain
      I deserve it all
      Your wrath is my justified fate
      Yet I hope you know my regrets,
      How remorseful those day without you have been.
