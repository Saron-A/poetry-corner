    <h1>Lonesome Romance</h1>
    <pre>
        Why is your love so much like loneliness
        Your heart a wilderness
        Like an endless desert
        I could walk and walk 
        All my life
        Never to reach the spring of your life,
        Why is your voice more like an echo
        Repeating into the void 
        Where you've blocked out all ears
        Your tears vigorously flowing 
        Through the cracks of your crumbling walls
        Your cries ringing hollow, 
        My soul has grown tired 
        My heart weary
        From missing you.
        Why is your smile bitter
        Your weeps coupled with laughter
        Humor or madness, Lord only knows
        You glare into nothingness
        Your thoughts far away, carried by the wind
        Dampened by the rain
        Drained by your ruins
        Trampled under stomping feet;
        Your hands have grown cold
        Your fingers tightly crossed
        In hopes of the night
        That seemingly stalls until overtaken by sunlight
        The days are bright, uncomfortably so
        I am already hoping for the brief nightfall
        And the even briefer twilight that sings soulfully
        before letting go,
        Then I'll fall onto the clouds
        Swim in the sky's limpid hue
        My tears wiped away
        Bidden farewell to life's miserable carriage
        And be Forever gone.
