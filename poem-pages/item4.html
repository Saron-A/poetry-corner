    <h1>Archaic Anxiety</h1>
    <pre>
        I waited on the moon
        All night long
        In the jungle of my anxiety
        Through the soft breeze and then the gale;
        Upon hearing the howling of wolves, my soul shuddered
        From worry my heart paled
        Yet I stayed put and recited our vows
        In this never ending uproar.
        I wept in the wildfire
        That was eating at my branches and trunks
        My shallow roots
        My withered leaves brushed against one another
        Fire on fire
        Out of control
        I had closed my eyes but I could smell what was left behind
        I heard the sound of the life that once was, running to hide
        Flora and fauna became non-existent
        The rain from my tears suddenly like gasoline
        Finished off the debris.
        Henceforth,
        The remaining of me is now a barren land
        One that can never grow
        Or rear life.
