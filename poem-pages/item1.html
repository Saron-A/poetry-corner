    <h1>Do Violets Plead Guilty</h1>
    <pre>
        Do the violets plead guilty
        For their deep tint
        The roses their innocence
        For the thorns they were blessed by the Almightly
        That make ones fingers bleed
        Would the venom vipers spit
        Bind them to solitude
        In the pits beneath the ground
        While lions roam in their jungles
        Digging their fangs into the flesh of their preys?
        And us humans
        We hunt, not out of nessesity
        Shoot arrows at beings that are striving to live
        Cutting life short for aesthetics
        The utility it holds being mere pleasure-
        Does one exist to envy another
        Does one die to hang on ones walls
        Aren't we all animals
        Yet with a soul and conscience to be judged by the Lord
        Are we not like flowers
        Stuck in a revolving planet
        Flopping and blooming with evolving seasons
        Losing petals day by day
        Withering under the scorching sun
        And drooping from heavy rains
        Cursed to sustain through thick and thin
        Till our unsteady hands fail to pass our threads through the eye of our needles
        Or till a tragedy snatches us from life's frail grip
        Don't we just stay
        Under the same sky
        In the same world
        Till we wilt and eventually pass
        Are we not all fading, day by day
        Under the same sky that is meant to fail?
