          <p>
            I hope you enjoy all the stuff I have written so far and will
            continue to write . Here's a little introduction about myself; My
            name is Saron Abebe. I am 22 years old and I live in Addis Ababa,
            Ethiopia. I have been writing poems since I was a little
            kid.However, I believe my writing met its turning point when I
            turned 16 and started reading different books and poetry. Exploring
            literatures from various authors opened a new dimension where I got
            exposed to different topics I can write about and expanded my
            imagination as well as vocabulary.My collection include poems of
            various genres such as romance, tragedy, adventure, and more. Feel
            free to reach out or give feedback on my content.
