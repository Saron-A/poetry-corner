          <p>
            I hope you enjoy all the stuff I have written so far and will
            continue to write . Here's a little introduction about myself; My
            name is Saron Abebe. I am a 22 year old female and I live in Addis
            Ababa, Ethiopia. I have been writing poems since I was young.
            However, I believe my writing met its turning point when I took up
            reading as a hobby and started engaging with different books as well
            as poetry. Exploring literatures from various authors and eras
            opened a new realm where I got exposed to different topics I could
            write about and expanded my imagination as well as vocabulary. My
            collection includes poems of various genres such as love, literary,
            adventure, and more. Feel free to reach out or give feedback on my
            content!
